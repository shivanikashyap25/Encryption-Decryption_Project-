# Encryption-Decryption_Project-

Encryption-Decryption Web Application
This project is a web-based platform that enables users to encrypt and decrypt messages using various algorithms, ensuring data security and confidentiality. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, the application provides an intuitive interface for users to securely encode and decode text messages.

# Key Features:
Text Encryption: Users can input plain text and choose an encryption algorithm to generate a secure, encoded message.
Text Decryption: The platform allows users to input encrypted text and decode it back to the original message using the correct key or algorithm.
Algorithm Options: The application supports different encryption techniques, offering flexibility and customization.
User-Friendly Interface: The interface is simple and easy to navigate, allowing users to quickly perform encryption and decryption tasks.
Real-Time Processing: Messages are encrypted and decrypted instantly, providing immediate feedback to the user.

# Technical Aspects:
HTML: Structures the application layout, including input fields and buttons.
CSS: Enhances the visual appeal and ensures a responsive design.
JavaScript: Implements the logic for encryption and decryption, handling user input and displaying results.

# Purpose:
The Encryption-Decryption Web Application is designed to help users secure their messages and understand basic cryptographic concepts. It serves as a practical tool for anyone interested in data security and encryption techniques, offering hands-on experience with secure communication.

This project highlights the importance of data privacy and demonstrates how web technologies can be used to implement simple yet effective encryption solutions.
